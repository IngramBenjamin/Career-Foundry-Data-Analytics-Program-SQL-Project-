# Career-Foundry-Data-Analytics-Program-SQL-Project-
This SQL project was part of the Career Foundry Data Analytics Program and utilized a database from a fictional movie rental company in order to use SQL to answer business questions about profitability and consumer demographics and behavior. Results were presented as visualizations created using Tableau. 

As part of the project I set out to answer the following business questions for "Rockbuster Stealth" to use for their upcoming annual company strategy. 
● Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
● What was the average rental duration for all videos?
● Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
● Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
● Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

The project used a data set of Rockbuster's film inventory, customers, payments, among other things. The data set was created by Career Foundry for the purpose of the project.
